# NETA DAO Workspace

Static governance workspace for DAO collaboration on Juno. The frontend combines private browser drafts, public UNI-7 review contracts and read-only mainnet governance data.

## Current product boundary

### NETA Operations DAO

- Private drafts are stored only in the current browser.
- Public review, revisions and discussions use the configured UNI-7 workshop contract.
- Publishing, revising and finalizing require positive Operations DAO voting power.
- Comments and replies require strictly more than 10 actively staked NETA.
- Existing Operations proposals and voting state are read from Juno mainnet.

### Juno Network Governance

- Mainnet proposals and current deposit/voting parameters are read-only.
- Community review is tested on UNI-7.
- Review writes require at least 1 delegated JUNOX and 1 actively staked test NETA.
- Mainnet deposit, `MsgSubmitProposal` and native Juno voting remain disabled until the exact transactions have been simulated and reviewed.
- A newly deployed Juno review contract is browser-local until its verified address is committed to the DAO registry in `neta-governance.js`.

### UX concepts

Delivery and Contributors remain visual drafts. Treasury asset balances are collected read-only from the NETA Operations DAO core address `juno1excm…mancl` and from Juno's native distribution-module Community Pool. IBC denoms are resolved from their on-chain denom traces so bridged representations remain separate positions with their origin visible. USD prices are refreshed centrally, while planning, commitments and runway remain explicitly marked sample values until their accounting model is connected.

LP positions remain visible as LP-token holdings. Each position expands into its proportional underlying reserves, and its USD value is calculated from those reserves exactly once; underlying amounts are not added again as free treasury tokens. The collector fails visibly on unavailable providers and retains source, timestamp and block height.

### Proposal deliverables

Drafts and public revisions can contain structured deliverables with a milestone title, deadline, responsible party, required confirmer and expected evidence. They are embedded in the existing `actions_json` array as entries with `type: "dao_deliverable_v1"`. This keeps the format backward-compatible with the deployed workshop contract while allowing the Delivery view to consume approved milestones later. Submission adapters must separate these planning records from executable chain messages.

When a connected user opens a discussion but lacks the configured comment stake, the workspace exposes that DAO's configured staking destination. The action is contextual; it is not shown when comment access is already satisfied, and staking does not imply DAO membership or publishing rights.

## Security properties

- User-provided content is rendered through DOM text nodes, not HTML injection sinks.
- Contract writes enforce authorization on-chain; frontend state is not trusted.
- The workshop rejects attached funds, starts paused and supports two-step owner transfer.
- Revision hashes are computed in the contract from stored canonical proposal content.
- Unverified `MarkSubmitted` calls are blocked until an on-chain submission adapter exists.
- Published revisions and comments are immutable; finalization closes discussion.
- The shipped Wasm is checked against `assets/neta_proposal_workshop.sha256` before browser deployment and in CI.

## Development

Rust is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Both contracts contain committed lockfiles.

```bash
cargo test --locked --manifest-path contracts/neta-proposal-workshop/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --manifest-path contracts/neta-proposal-workshop/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --manifest-path contracts/workshop-access-mock/Cargo.toml
node --test tests/frontend-smoke.test.mjs
```

Build the review contract reproducibly:

```bash
bash scripts/build-wasm.sh neta-proposal-workshop
```

The CI workflow validates CosmWasm compatibility and verifies that the built Wasm is byte-identical to the shipped browser artifact.

UNI-7 deployment behavior, known API compatibility constraints and the state-based transaction recovery procedure are documented in [`UNI7_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`](UNI7_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md).

## Deployment rule

Changes go through a pull request and must pass contract/frontend CI. Do not enable native Juno submission or treasury execution from frontend-only validation.
